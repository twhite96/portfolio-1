Exploring Gatsby for self-expression.

My [current portfolio](https://www.tiffanyrwhite.com/) is written in Jekyll with a premade theme I found on GitHub. I have had many different versions over the years[^1], most of which I have found some boilerplate online and customized it[^2].


## Below are some screenshots of my current portfolio.


It's nice enough, but *I* didn't design or build this. I just edited a template and there it was. Finished portfolio. That's it. Right?

## Time to grow up

Losing my job was the best thing to happen to me as a dev for a variety of reasons. Having the job in the first place and flailing was *also* one of the best things to happen to me. I learned so much by struggling daily with the tasks I needed to do. Once laid off and stepping back a bit, I took the opportunity to learn and build stuff and get better as a developer. I did some [hard](https://bumped.com/) [things](https://tiffanywhite.dev/2020/06/26/flexing-my-css-muscles-by-adding-a-bit-of-panache/), some [fun](https://fakerdata.tiffstuff.dev/) [things](https://glitch.com/~faker-api), and took up some courses to learn [algorithms](https://www.algoexpert.io/product) and [system design](https://www.algoexpert.io/systems/fundamentals).

I've leveled up *even more so* than [just a couple months ago](https://tiffanywhite.dev/2020/03/14/laid-off-but-leveled-up-lessons-learned/). I have confidence. So I feel like it is beyond time to expand my skills and *rebuild my entire portfolio from scratch*.

## Portfolio Inspo

I don't know how I came upon [Brittany Chiang's portfolio](https://brittanychiang.com/) but I am glad I did. I am struck by the animations, the design, the aesthetic. It is right up my alley. The problem is *I am not skilled enough at design to pull this off*.


So instead of just straight up forking this and editing it, I downloaded the zip to my machine and went through the code, looking at the package file to see what was installed. It's a Gatsby site, which I am familiar with, so I looked at the config, the webpack config, and more. [I even asked a question](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4/issues/80) about a webpack config I didn't understand in the repo and when answered, went looking deeper for documentation on the limitations of webpack server-side rendering.

I am *not* ripping this off. I will do *my own* design and make it nice, going just *slightly above* my comfort level.

## Gatsby is my choice for portfolio self-expression

Gatbsy boilerplate is easy to get running and configurable. Then it is up to you to make it your own. I am using the [gatsby-starter-default Starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/) and going from there.

Ali Spittel [explained it best on the We Learn Code blog](https://welearncode.com/building-a-kickass-portfolio/):

> Make a portfolio that is a true expression of yourself. Programming is in a lot of ways a creative field, so use your creativity!

[...]

> I would steer away from using a template found online -- to me, it's pretty apparent when these are used. I understand using them for people who aren't web developers, but if you are a web developer show off your skills!

That's good enough reason for me to *grow up and get my hands dirty*.

[^1]: I tried to find my first ever version from the freeCodeCamp curriculum on CodePen but I deleted it. It was *awful* haha.
[^2]: There was one I didn't customize and instead built from scratch.
