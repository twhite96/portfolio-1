I've been a frontend developer for quite a while; it took me a long time to realize that I was in tutorial hell and that in order for me to get better, I'd actually need to build, and finish, something tangible.

I've built a few things, nothing special. I was building a full stack app with Supabase and Next, with Supabase Auth on top, and a component library with React, TailwindCSS, and Storybook.

But as time wore on, I noticed something- *I really, really, don't want to do this anymore*, and by *this* I mean *web development*.

## What changed?

Well, lots of things really. Here is a list, in no particular order, of the reasons I'm done with web:

- I suck at design, and I don't want to learn it
- I hate, literally hate, working with CSS (though I am amazed at what CSS wizards can make, y'all are amazing)
- I've been fighting with JavaScript for close to 10 years and as I've gotten to be a better overall software engineer, I have begun to detest it, especially the frameworks
- It moves far, far too fast
- I've spent more hours, and I mean, *a lot more* hours in my network, setting up my home lab, and learning cybersecurity
- Cyber has interested me my whole life
- When I first went to college I was going to be a Network Engineer, it was my major, but I switched because I didn't know any better and was a pretentious, arrogant little shit
- The tools and around sysadmin have gotten better, there's more to do
- Lower level languages feel right to me, have felt right to me, but I was afraid to say it out loud because of the swaths of web devs I felt would hate that I said I preferred C++, Rust, and languages like Go and Python more than anything JavaScript

These are the reasons. And I am going in a different direction altogether while still in the tech space.

And this is where I hang up my cleats, and put this blog in my locker, and head to retirement. It will remain up for posterity. But, it was a ride. Almost 10 years of posts here.

So long, and thanks for all the fish.
